# FINWISE - AI Financial Assistant

This Streamlit app provides a local RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) assistant for finance documents, with PDF/TXT upload, document search, optional web fallback search, and basic math solving.

Features
- Upload PDF and TXT files; stored embeddings are saved to the Chroma vector store.
- Ask questions via a submit form (press Enter or click Submit).
- Local document search first; if not found, you can allow web search (DuckDuckGo) which will run only after you confirm.
- Math queries are solved using SymPy (step-like output shown).
- Logs are saved to `rag_app.log` and shown in the terminal.

Quick start

1. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Notes
- The app now requires you to press Submit before any search runs (prevents searches on each keystroke).
- If you click "Yes, Search Web", the app will go directly to the web search on the next rerun without re-checking documents.
- Math support requires `sympy` (included in requirements). For complex step-by-step derivations the output is generated by SymPy and may vary.
